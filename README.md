### About

We came across Bricin in 1996 in Killarney, Ireland. We realized this was a great name and have since used @bricin on most social media, web sites, etc. Originally this site was a random collection of fitness, health, personal improvements, travelogue, books, food, and a lot of other random thoughts. It was variously hosted on WordPress, Tumblr, Path, and then back to WordPress, and now on GitHub Pages while we work on what comes next.

We are not associated with the Bricin Gallery in Killarney (although they are very fine folk) and can be found at www.bricin.ie.
